  Completed a simple mouse event handling on X11 windows. the appropriate mask has to be provided to the method 'XSelectInput' to work.
  
  Next: The Expose event appears to way to be to redraw a screen (otherwise, it looks like I will continue to have segmentation fault problem)
        Continue to study the project in the folder 'drawing' as it draws line and text correctly with no exception.

    The Video here is where the code come from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZmJwk2xrJ0
